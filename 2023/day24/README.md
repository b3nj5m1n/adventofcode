Turns out part 2 is wayyy easier than I thought, you don't have to solve the whole system of 900 equations with ~300 unknown variables, you can just grab the first couple of lines from the input and that's it.

Part 1 was relatively easy, got a little help from chatgpt so I wouldn't have to read nalgebra documentation for hours.
Realised what you had to do for part 2 relatively quickly, got a prototype working in sage math (see jupyter notebook), then ran it on the actual input and I don't think it's made any progress in the ~8 hours I had it running.
So yeah I had the solution for about 8 hours but I didn't realise it.
test2.sage solves part 2 for the hard-coded input.

We'll see if I can work up the motivation to implement the actual solution in rust.
